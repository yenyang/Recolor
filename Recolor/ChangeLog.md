## Note for Asset Creators
We don't know when official support for the Asset Editor Mesh Import will happen, but. . .
To best support the Recolor mod, I ask that if you’re designing a building, and if you want that building to have color variations in separate channels for the walls and roofs please use channel0/R for walls and channel1/G for the roof.
