## Note for Asset Creators
We don't know when official support for the Asset Editor Mesh Import will happen, but. . .
To best support the Recolor mod, I ask that if youï¿½re designing a building, and if you want that building to have color variations in separate channels for the walls and roofs please use channel0/R for walls and channel1/G for the roof.

## Translations
I am looking for volunteers to help translate the mod into the other languages. For those interested please find the project in the crowdin or discord link. CSL2:CODEMODS -&gt; mods-wip -&gt; Recolor. Also see Crowdin link.

# Detailed Description
## Recolor Panel Section
Adds a Recolor section to the top left panel when selecting an asset instance if the main mesh of that asset supports custom colors. This panel section has 3 color fields with Hue, Saturation, and Brightness sliders that will change up to three colors of the asset. The asset must have been designed to utilize customizable colors, not all assets utilize all 3 colors, and the parts affected by each color in the color set are predefined and cannot be changed. An unsupported color channel are often by default just white. 

The Recolor panel can control the single instance colors or color variations of all assets that utilize the matching mesh and color variation. Single instance colors of plants and trees is not currently supported. Color changes are immediately applied and saved into this save game. With a button press you can save color variations to the ModsData folder so that color variation will be a default for all other saves. These xml files can also be shared out of game. 

The panel features copy, paste, reset, swap channel functions. Sets of colors and single color fields can be independently copied and pasted, and are separate. The panel can be minimized when not being used. The panel has a color picker tool as an alternative to copy/paste. 

All vehicles from a specific service building can have an assigned color set which will affect existing and newly spawned vehicles from that service building.

All vehicles along an assigned route can have an assigned color set which will affect existing and newly spawned vehicles from that route.

While changing Single Instance colors on a prefab with Multiple Meshes, you can limit color changes to individual submeshes, matching submeshes, or all submeshes.

While changing Matching Color Variations on a prefab with Multiple Meshes, you are limited to only matching submeshes and it will not change all submeshes. You can pick which type of submesh to change. 

Optional Hexidecimal input for colors.

You can select NetLane fences and hedges placed by EDT or inside buildings using a tool activated by keyboard shortcut (default Alt + F).

## Color Painter Tool
The recolor panel has a button to activate the color painter tool. You can also use a customizable keyboard shortcut (default Shift + P). By default when activating the color painter tool the color set of the selected asset is copied automatically. This can be changed in settings. 

The color painter tool has similar functionality to the recolor panel but with a different workflow. It is faster but changes to the colors are not applied immediately, you must select the asset to apply changes. Paint tool mode uses left mouse button to change colors, and right mouse button to do a quick reset. Reset tool mode will only highlight assets that can be reset and uses left mouse button to apply the reset. You can copy/paste colors between the color painter tool and the Recolor panel. The color painter has its own color picker tool mode as an alternative to copy/paste. For even faster application you can change instance colors of buildings, props, and vehicles over a radius. You must choose the filter that you want to use between those three. 

Channels can be toggle with the painter, but may require knowing what channel affect what on the subjects.

## Palettes
Palettes are a customizable set of invididual Color Swatches that can be assigned to a Color Channel. A random Color Swatch will be chosen from the Palette. 
The mod comes with 19 pre-built Palettes and 4 pre-built Subcategories for Palettes.
You can create new, edit, and delete any Palette or Subcategory. Subcategories allow you to organize Palettes within the selection drop down.
Palettes and Subcategories are saved locally in your ModsData folder for the mod and are available in all save games. You can share the folders with other people out-of-game.
Add localized names and optional descriptions using the in-game Palette Editor Menu.

You can assign Palettes with the Selected Info Panel, Color Painter Tool, Color Picker Tool, or during placement with vanilla tools.
Palettes chosen during placement will by default be remembered for each asset per save game so that the next time you place that asset in that save game, it will default to those previously chosen Palettes.
You can setup Palettes or Subcategories to show or not show in the Palette Chooser for specific Categories. Palettes can also be filtered based on specific Themes, Packs, or Zone Types.
Saving edits to a Palette that has already been assigned in a save game will adjust the colors where that Palette has been assigned.
Using Palettes is optional and many UI elements can be hidden or toggled off if not being used.
## Limitations
* Not all buildings or props support custom colors because their mesh was not designed to support this. For instance most unique buildings were intended to be unique.
* To select sub-objects other than service upgrades and utilize the Recolor panel, you must enable DevUI Tab Menu -&gt; Simulation tab -&gt; Debug Toggle. The color painter can target sub-objects without debug toggle.

## Other Color Variation Mods
Other existing mods such as Tree Controller and Vehicle Variation Packs by Konsi/Mimonsi contain curated sets of color variations. This mod is intended to be the user override for those mods. You can still use those other mods that affect color variation, but this mod should take precedence if you've assigned an overriding color variation.

## Support
I will respond on the code modding channels on **Cities: Skylines Modding Discord**
